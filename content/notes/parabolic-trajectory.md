Using two kinematics equations, which are the parametric equations, a uniform linear motion in horizontal direction and a non-uniform linear motion in vertical directions, a parabolic trajectory can be obtained.


## horizontal direction
In $x$ direction ..

$$\tag{1}
$$

..


## vertical direction
In $y$ direction ..

$$\tag{2}
$$

..


## combining equations
Using previous equations ..

$$\tag{3}
$$
