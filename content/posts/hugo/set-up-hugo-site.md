Several steps are required to set up a Hugo site in Windows. In general the steps includes download and install Hugo, create and clone repository in GitHub, make a new site with Hugo, add theme, tune configuration, post article, and push changes to GitHub.


## download
Latest version is [v0.112.3](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.112.3) which is released three days ago by [bep](https://github.com/bep). The filename `hugo_extended_0.112.3_windows-amd64.zip` has size about 18.6 MB.


## install
+ Extract the zip file ang put `hugo.exe`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` files to `C:\Hugo\bin`.
+ Add `C:\Hugo\bin` to Path of your user veriables by editing system environmental variables.
+ Test it
  ```shell
  L:\home>hugo version
  hugo v0.112.3-ba6f74e40420d76f15fc8c2358be90f7aca98e0e+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2023-05-24T14:42:50Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
  ```

## repository
+ Create a GitHub repository, which is https://github.com/dudung/x in this case.
+ Clone it.
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/dudung/x
  Cloning into 'x'...

  remote: Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.

  ```

## create site
Here site and folder name is `x`.
  ```
  L:\home>hugo new site x --force
  Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in L:\home\x.

  Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

  1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
     Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
     create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
  2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
     with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
  3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

  Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
  ```

## add theme
Hugo-Coder theme is used here.
```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git themes/hugo-coder

```


## tune configuration
+ Modify cofiguration file, where Hugo version 0.95.0 uses `config.toml`, while version 0.112.3 uses `hugo.toml`.

```toml
baseURL = 'https://dudung.github.io/x'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'x'
theme = 'hugo-coder'
```


### add files
`content/about.md`.
```md
# about
It is me, @6unpnp.
```

`static/img/avatar.svg` &rightarrow; [avatar.svg](https://github.com/dudung/x/blob/main/static/img/avatar.svg)


## modify files
Modify `layouts/partials/footer.html` from
```
{{ i18n "powered_by" }}
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> &
<a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/">Coder</a>.
```
to
```
{{ i18n "powered_by" }}
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> &
<a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/">Coder</a> &
<a href="https://iconscout.com/contributors/dmitriy-bondarchuk">IconScout</a>.
